# CSSE2002_Farm Assignment 2 (Part 2)
---
Assignment 2 of CSSE2002 (Programming in the Large) focused less on writing and learning Java
but more on how to design, test and refactor code. Both from code written myself, and code provided to me.

The main addition to CSSE2002 Farm was the addition of a CLI mini-game. The trick however, the given
implementation of this functionality was quite poorly written. This created the problem of the assignment
where I needed to design and create tests (using JUnit4), learn about and apply SOLID design principles, and
improve my debugging skills.

This project made me learn so much about how to design and create large programs. The debugging skills are
invaluable and the knowledge of programming design principles like SOLID have definitely made me  abetter programmer.
